ML Insights into Friktion Labs SDK Asset Data with Python Neural Networks

The neural network machine learning algorithm uses data from the Friktion Labs SDK to look for interactions between the users and asset groups. This machine learning challenge could be used to discover patterns and interactions between unique users and assets over time. This could help to optimize customer service and optimize resources based on usage of assets and groups of users. The data generated from the Friktion SDK can be found under assets.csv.
